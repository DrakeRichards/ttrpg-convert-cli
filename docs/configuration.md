# CLI Configuration guide

The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a means to tailor data transformation using configuration files. 
These files, written in JSON or YAML, establish guidelines for how data is converted.

In this guide, we'll walk through the configuration options and their practical uses.

> üöÄ Remember to respect copyrights, and use only the sources you own.

## Overview

Below is a detailed example of a `config.json` file. This configuration aims to:

- Choose specific data sources.
- Set target paths for the resulting content.
- Designate which content to include or exclude.
- Incorporate complete sources, such as entire books or adventures.

```json
{
    "from": [
        "AI",
        "PHB",
        "DMG",
        "TCE",
        "LMoP",
        "ESK",
        "DIP",
        "XGE",
        "FTD",
        "MM",
        "MTF",
        "VGM",
        "LoX"
    ],
    "paths": {
        "rules": "/compendium/rules/"
    },
    "excludePattern": [
        "race|.*|dmg"
    ],
    "exclude": [
        "monster|expert|dc",
        "monster|expert|sdw",
        "monster|expert|slw"
    ],
    "include": [
        "race|changeling|mpmm"
    ],
    "full-source": {
        "adventure": [
            "LMoP",
            "LoX"
        ],
        "book": [
            "5etools-mirror-1.github.io/data/book/book-phb.json"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Select data sources with the `from` key

The `from` key lets you specify which sources to draw data from. 
List the codes or abbreviations for your chosen sources.

**Example:**

```json
  "from": [
    "AI",
    "PHB",
    ...
  ]
```

> üöÄ Note: Ensure you own the content you're including. Find the abbreviations for your sources in the [Source Map](https://github.com/ebullient/ttrpg-convert-cli/blob/main/docs/sourceMap.md).

## Specify target paths with the `paths` key

The `paths` key informs the CLI where to store the generated content.

- New directories are made if they aren't already present.
- Paths are relative to the CLI's designated output location (`-o`).

Content typically falls into:

- `compendium`: most backgrounds, classes, items, spells, monsters, etc.
- `rules`: conditions, weapon properties, variant rules, etc.

**Example:**

```json
  "paths": {
    "compendium": "/compendium/",
    "rules": "/rules/"
  }
```

üîπ The leading slash is optional. It marks a path starting from the root of your Obsidian vault.

## Refine content choices

You can achieve more precision in content selection by utilizing data keys.

The CLI `--index` option compiles two lists of data keys:
- `allIndex.json`: Lists all potential data keys.
- `allSourceIndex.json`: Lists the data keys actually used in your output.

### Exclude items matching an `excludePattern`

This option allows you to exclude data entries based on matching patterns.

```json
"excludePattern": [
    "race|.*|dmg"
]
```

### Exclude items with `exclude`

Specify the data keys you want to omit.

```json
"exclude": [
    "monster|expert|dc",
    ...
]
```

### Include items with `include`

Specify the data keys you want to include.

```json
"include": [
    "race|changeling|mpmm"
]
```

This is particularly useful for content acquired piecemeal, like individual items from D&D Beyond.

### Include source-book content with `full-source`

By default, the CLI generates notes for specific items like monsters or spells. 

Use the `full-source` key if you want to generate notes for the text of the source you own, either book or adventure. To fully incorporate a source, its abbreviation should appear in both the `from` list and the `full-source` section.

> üìù The `convert` configuration attribute is an older (less intuitive) name for `full-source`.

Here is an example that will create notes for the *Player's Handbook* (a book, PHB) and *The Wild Beyond the Witchlight* (an adventure, WBtW):

```json
"from": {
    "PHB",
    "WBtW"
    ...
}
...
"full-source": {
    "adventure": [
        "WBtW",
        ...
    ],
    "book": [
        "5etools-mirror-1.github.io/data/book/book-phb.json"
    ]
}
```

Note that you can either use the resource identifier ("WBtW") or specify the path to the resource JSON (".../book-phb.json") file in the `full-source` section.

Some adventures may be broken down into individual modules. If there's any confusion about how to reference them (book or adventure), the generated index (`allIndex.json`) can be a helpful reference.
